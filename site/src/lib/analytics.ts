// Analytics + early-access handoff — the one place the site names them.

// Counter: self-hosted Umami at insight.truearchitect.ai (cookieless, no IP stored;
// the script and beacon are named generically so list-based blockers do not match).
// Emitted ONLY when the build runs with SITE_ENV=production (the Pages deploy job);
// local builds and any preview emit nothing. The website id is not a secret — it is
// visible in every page that carries the snippet — so it lives here, not in CI.
//
// Handoff: every early-access CTA on this site links OUT to truearchitect.ai, which
// owns the form and the list. The site never collects anything itself.
// Heatmaps: the same server's recorder captures click positions and scroll depth for a
// sample of visits (aggregated only; replay is OFF on the dashboard, nothing is played back).
